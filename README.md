# pokemon-randomizer-graphQL-react
Simple React/GraphQL responsive app that returns a random amount of pokemon, and their individual stats from gen 1. Purpose of this small application was to get familiar with GraphQL queries, and apollo.

To run the app simply clone the repo to your local, npm install, and npm run watch. After those have both finished, just open index.html within your file explorer.
